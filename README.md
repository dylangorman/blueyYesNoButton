The Yes/No Button from Bluey!
My Kids Love The TV Show Bluey, especially the Episode Dance Mode!
They Kept asking if they could get a Yes/No Button from the show. Unfortunately they don't exists Physically. So I decided to make one using html and css and a littl bit of JS Script.
It was a fun little project I did in 2 hours.
Enjoy!
