The Yes/No Button from Bluey!
My Kids Love The TV Show Bluey, especially the Episode Dance Mode!
They Kept asking if they could get a Yes/No Button from the show. Unfortunately they don't exist Physically. So I decided to make one using html and css and a little bit of JS Script. I tried using the orignal Audio from the show, but couldn't isolate the "YES" or "NO" to a satisfactory state. So I tried to emulate the voice as best as I could. 
It was a fun little 2 hour project
Enjoy!
